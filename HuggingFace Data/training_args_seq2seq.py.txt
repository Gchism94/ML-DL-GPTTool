    Args:
        sortish_sampler (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether to use a *sortish sampler* or not. Only possible if the underlying datasets are *Seq2SeqDataset*
            for now but will become generally available in the near future.

            It sorts the inputs according to lengths in order to minimize the padding size, with a bit of randomness
            for the training set.
        predict_with_generate (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether to use generate to calculate generative metrics (ROUGE, BLEU).
        generation_max_length (`int`, *optional*):
            The `max_length` to use on each evaluation loop when `predict_with_generate=True`. Will default to the
            `max_length` value of the model configuration.
        generation_num_beams (`int`, *optional*):
            The `num_beams` to use on each evaluation loop when `predict_with_generate=True`. Will default to the
            `num_beams` value of the model configuration.
        generation_config (`str` or `Path` or [`~generation.GenerationConfig`], *optional*):
            Allows to load a [`~generation.GenerationConfig`] from the `from_pretrained` method. This can be either:

            - a string, the *model id* of a pretrained model configuration hosted inside a model repo on
              huggingface.co.
            - a path to a *directory* containing a configuration file saved using the
              [`~GenerationConfig.save_pretrained`] method, e.g., `./my_model_directory/`.
            - a [`~generation.GenerationConfig`] object.
    

        Serializes this instance while replace `Enum` by their values and `GenerationConfig` by dictionaries (for JSON
        serialization support). It obfuscates the token values by removing their value.
