    Hashable dictionary to store image size information.
    

        Given the input settings e.g. do_resize, build the image transforms.
        

    Computes the output image size given the input image and the maximum allowed height and width. Keep aspect ratio.
    Important, even if image_height < max_height and image_width < max_width, the image will be resized
    to at least one of the edges be equal to max_height or max_width.

    For example:
        - input_size: (100, 200), max_height: 50, max_width: 50 -> output_size: (25, 50)
        - input_size: (100, 200), max_height: 200, max_width: 500 -> output_size: (200, 400)

    Args:
        image_size (`Tuple[int, int]`):
            The image to resize.
        max_height (`int`):
            The maximum allowed height.
        max_width (`int`):
            The maximum allowed width.
    

    Squeezes a tensor, but only if the axis specified has dim 1.
    

    Return the maximum value across all indices of an iterable of values.
    

    Get the maximum height and width across all images in a batch.
