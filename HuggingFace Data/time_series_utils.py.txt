Time series distributional output classes and utilities.


        Returns the mean of the distribution.
        

        Returns the variance of the distribution.
        

        Returns the standard deviation of the distribution.
        

        Shape of each individual event contemplated by the distributions that this object constructs.
        

        Number of event dimensions, i.e., length of the `event_shape` tuple, of the distributions that this object
        constructs.
        

        A float that will have a valid numeric value when computing the log-loss of the corresponding distribution. By
        default 0.0. This value will be used when padding data series.
        

        Return the parameter projection layer that maps the input to the appropriate parameters of the distribution.
        

        Converts arguments to the right shape and domain. The domain depends on the type of distribution, while the
        correct shape is obtained by reshaping the trailing axis in such a way that the returned tensors define a
        distribution of the right event_shape.
        

        Helper to map inputs to the positive orthant by applying the square-plus operation. Reference:

    Student-T distribution output class.
    

    Normal distribution output class.
